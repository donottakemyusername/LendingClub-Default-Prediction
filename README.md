# LendingClub-Default-Prediction
This is a credit scoring model that predicts loan default rates with a 3-layered feed-forward neural network model for LendingClub. I optimized the model
with stochastic gradient descent and achieved an accuracy of 90%. 
I have implemented EarlyStopping and Dropout to avoid overfitting; added batch normalization for data scaling, and tested the model with 500 epochs with
different batch sizes to improve performance.
